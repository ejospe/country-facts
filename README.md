 # Intro to Git and GitHub training - Observer training

This repository was created for a training in Git and GitHub at [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics). This is one of our two beginner trainings. Which of those two beginner trainings that is best for you depend on which role you will have in the repositories that you will collaborate on.

This is the training for someone that will be an Observer. An Observer uses GitHub to provide feedback on code, but does not contribute to the code. If you contribute to code then the _Intro to Git and GitHub training - Contributor training_  is a better fit for you. More on DIME Analytics suggested role division when collaborating using GitHub [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/GitHub-Roles--AoWbLV_K7Wn_FcrkGnZRlW4oAg-IXdy2rnRN0Nt917h0nkI7).

We hope you will end up finding Git and GitHub as useful as we do!

## Content of this repository

This repository contains a country-fact file where the team member in DIME Analytics has written facts about their countries. Many of these facts are incorrect as a point of this training is for the person who attends this training will be trained in how to use GitHub to provide feedback on content that is wrong and needs to be updated.

We do not use code in our trainings as not everyone attending our trainings use the same programming language, and code that is unfamiliar to you is distracting. That is why we use this country-fact file to practice on, so we can learn the GitHub features we will use on code in the future, without being distracted by code during the training.
